                                                An application to perform tasks assigned by admin users.
                                                the application contains a login and registration form for 
                                                the user and login form for admin role.
                                                Only one Admin needs to be created.
                                                The Admin function is to create tasks for users.
                                                When creating a task, the admin chooses the time when the 
                                                task will be delivered to all users.
                                                The task is delivered by e-mail.
                                                The admin has an overview of all the tasks he has created, 
                                                their status and a percentage of how many users have successfully 
                                                completed and how many failed.
                                                The user can log in to the application at any time, review their 
                                                tasks and mark them as successfully or unsuccessfully completed 
                                                (with successfully completed, submit a photo as proof) and see 
                                                the status of tasks for which they have completed and their time 
                                                has not expired.
                                                After receiving the task by e-mail, the user is obliged to stipulate 
                                                that he has completed the task within 60 minutes and to submit a photo 
                                                with the task as proof, if he does not complete it in 60 minutes, the 
                                                task status automatically changes to failed.
                                                At the end of the week, Admin has an insight into the 10 most successful 
                                                users, for that same week. 
                                                A button appears on the last day of the week that the admin clicks on 
                                                and takes it to a page showing the 10 most successful users and how many 
                                                tasks they have done.
